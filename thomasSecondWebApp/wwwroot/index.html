<!--Build an ASP.NET Web App using the same structure as in the "Building First Web App" series of videos. (i.e. Non-MVC)

Include:

Title
Header that lists your preferred name
A picture of yourself doing something you enjoy
A paragraph on what you hope to get out of this IS 413 class
A list of the Top #3 jobs you are most interested in pursuing when you graduate
A "Grade Calculator" form that takes as input a percentage of each grade category listed in the syllabus
An icon for the website (displayed on the tab next to the title) (#notcoveredinthevideos)
Style the site using a CSS file.  Level of styling is up to you, but only CSS for now.  (No Bootstrap, Angular, etc. on this assignment. We'll get there!)

Build a JavaScript program that calculates and displays both a final percentage and a letter grade using the "Grade Calculator" form entries based on the weights listed in the syllabus.

As always, write good code (use indentation, commenting, whitespace, descriptive variable names, etc.)

Submit a link to the GitHub Repository containing your project. (NOTE:  Make sure the repository is Public so the TAs can access it.)-->

            <h2>What I hope to get out of IS 413</h2>
            <p>This semester, I really want to take the opportunity to not only learn new coding languages, but I want to form my own method of internalizing what I learn. Up to this point in my college career, I haven't perfected my craft in how I study and apply course material. I want to not only learn a bunch of new material, but I want to do so in a way that will most benefit me in the future.
